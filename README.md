# Grocer

This is an app made on codeHS that allows users to make a list of the items of groceries that they need, maintain their desired budget, and determine if they were inside or outside of their desired budget. This was for a end of year project where we could decide what we could make. This was completed on May 16, 2023.

## Design Thinking Process:
Empathize: We have identified our users to be individuals that go grocery shopping often and usually use a paper to list their groceries. We have learned that these users often have a budget and may sometimes forget their list at home.

**Define:**  Grocer provides our users with a budget bar where they can track their budget as they are purchasing products. Our app also provides a way for the user to list the groceries they need without having to worry about leaving their list home.

**Ideate:** Some of the ideas we came up with included but not limited to: Having a dynamic input for price and quantity, icons or pictures of the items needed, and having a scroll list where the user can include dynamic amount of items.

**Prototype:** We had different versions of the app that varied in the display. We worked hard to make the UI user friendly and be effective in what we need the user to focus on. The first prototype can be seen at the bottom of the page.

**Test:** The dynamic input was not possible without having a button that would call the adding function as the completion circle is clicked. We also figured out a way to have different screens on an app using React Native.

**Reflection:** This was an interesting project to start as it provided much insight into the process behind developing an app. Some of the aspects of the app that we had to work on included having multiple pages, create the algorithm that multiplies and adds to the total price and quantity, and the algorithm that compares the budgets and price totals to determine the next page. I really liked how I had to use many of resources in order to achieve the look and functionality that I wanted for the app. If we had more time, I would have made a back button on the page that displays whether or not the user stayed within their budget. I would have also made the list view dynamic and with a scroll view. With even more time, I would have a database where the user enters lists and can later access them so they don't need to make the list on the spot.
